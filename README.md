### How To Run
To run this project locally, open a terminal (for example, `cmd.exe` or `Git Bash`) and navigate to the project's root directory (where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located).  
To build the containers, run the following command: `docker-compose build`  
To run the already built containers, run: `docker-compose up`  
You can also build the containers and run them simultaneously: `docker-compose up --build`  
If you want the containers to run in the background (even if you close the terminal), append the `-d` argument to the end of a command:
`docker-compose up -d` or `docker-compose up --build -d`  
To shut the containers down while they are working in the background, run:
`docker-compose down`  
To shut the containers down and destroy all the data stored in a database, run:
`docker-compose down -v`

There is no HTTPS configured for the local web-host.
